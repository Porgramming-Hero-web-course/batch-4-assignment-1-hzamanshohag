### The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

- Union type allows us to use any type between those two types. Because of union type, complex types of work are quite easy. Due to union type, it requires less writing of types. When any two types can be used together, the middle of the intersection can be used. You generally can use union values-for example, assign or test for equality-without knowing the exact type. The intersection type is a way of combining multiple types into one in TypeScript. You can mix several types together to create a new type that contains all the properties of the original types.
